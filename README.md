## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I should try and organize some sections in the code to be cleaner and neater.

### Useful resources

- [Gatsby official docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) - This helped me for implementing all the Gatsby features and understanding the Gatsby eco-system.
